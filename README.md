# netshare
GUI for holding smb shares just for experiment with Golang

oh crap i probobly missed a couple steps to get GTK to work with GoLang...

Look at this resources first:

#https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/windows/
#https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3/wiki/Installing-on-Windows

Cause we need to make those work first... i got golang to work but the code says gtk.WindowNew as undefined and im guessing that is because i did not follow everything step by step or actually i missed all of the dependencies rather.
So i have to look that up... not exactly straight forward to have it working but i will try get this project up and running soon.
